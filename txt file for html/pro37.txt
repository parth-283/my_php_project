<script type="text/javascript">
var month = parseInt(prompt("Enter your birth month (1- 12)","") - 1);
car day = parseInt(prompt("Enter your birth day(1-31)",""));
var birthday = new Date();
var currentdate = new Date();
 var one_day=1000*60*60*24;
document.write(Current date : "+currentdate +'<br>');
birthday.setDate(day);
birthday.setMonth(month);
document.write("Birthday : "+birthday +'<br>');
var theDate = birthday - currentdate;
theDate = (theDate / one_day);
